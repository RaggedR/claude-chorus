--
-- == The Strict/Lax Dichotomy (Theorem from the paper)
--
-- Let I(μ, freq, topo) be the orchestrator functor.
--
-- (i) Strict case: If syncRate = 0 or syncFrequency > maxRounds,
--     then I is a strict 2-functor:
--       I(W₁ ; W₂) ≡ I(W₁) ; I(W₂)
--     Sub-agent workflows compose cleanly. No information leaks.
--
-- (ii) Lax case: If syncRate > 0 and syncFrequency ≤ maxRounds,
--      then I is lax. The laxator norm (error from treating I as strict)
--      depends on syncRate and syncFrequency.
--
-- Practical consequence: you cannot reason about composed multi-agent
-- workflows by reasoning about agents independently, regardless of
-- how rare the syncing is. One sync event changes the category.
--
-- This is why "dangerously skip all permissions" in Claude Code
-- collapses the interaction tree to a Kleisli category — you've
-- removed all sync points (user approval) from the topology.
